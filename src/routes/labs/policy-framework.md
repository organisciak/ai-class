## AI Policy Framework

*Week 8*

Competencies: **Society, Ethics, and Policy**, Critical Analysis, Technical Understanding

### Overview

Develop guidelines for AI use in a specific organizational context, addressing ethical considerations and practical implementation.

### Details

Select a specific context (e.g., library, classroom, workplace, hobby community, etc.) and audience (e.g. AI for undergraduates, for job seekers, for lawyers, for educators, for small business owners, for DMs, etc).

*You’ll be preparing a draft of an AI Policy or AI Recommendation handout for that audience and context.*

Next, choose your angle. 

1. Is it *policy,* dictating how you are allowed to use AI in the context, or *recommendations*, teaching how you *may* benefit from it. If policy, note reasoning for decisions. If recommendations, and LLMs chat bots are insufficient, research additional fit-for-purpose tools.
2. is it more valuable in your context to offer high level advice (e.g. here’s how this applies to you, here are the risks you should avoid), or grounded, direct advice (e.g. here are specific tools you should know about; here are relevant approaches to prompted, etc.).

Whichever angle you choose, pursue it constructively. 

### Completion Details

Given the structure of our class, you don’t need to prepare the final handout: we don’t have space for that scale of effort.

Rather, you’ll prepare an *outline* of the key points. 1) Who you’re targeting; 2) what structure and tact you’d take; then 3) an outline of points in each section. This should communicate your ideas directly and succinctly.

Post your outline to the class Canvas.

### Portfolio Details

*Size: 1 point*

If including in portfolio: No need to add anything to your post.

Grading will focus on the clarity and appropriateness of your ideas and approach; the practical applicability of recommendation; and the evidence of understanding relevant AI principles.
