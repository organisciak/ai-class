## New Hobby

*Week 4*

Competencies: ***Art and Creativity***, Skilling and Productivity, Technical Understanding

### Overview

A key advantage of artificial intelligence on information behavior is the ability to speak user language instead of systems language. This make it valuable for familiarizing yourself with now domains and spaces. You can ask naive questions without knowing the jargon, and learn the skills and the language together.

Use AI to assist in learning a new skill or exploring a new hobby, documenting the learning process.

### Details

Choose a small ‘new thing’ you want to learn in your daily life and use appropriate tools - either chat bot or specialist tools - to pursue that goal.

Keep track of your successes and failures. Note if the exercise overall was satisfying or not, and consider why.

Please be safe. Don’t set out to rework electrical or juggle chainsaws.

### Completion Details

We’ll share our hobby at the start of next week’s class.
