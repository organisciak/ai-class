## AI Art Exhibition and Critique

**Competencies:** Art and Creativity

### **Overview**

The class will curate a virtual gallery of AI-generated art or images with accompanying commentary.

### **Details**

***Step 1 - For Your Consideration***

Use an image generator to create and iterate AI generated images. Some options:

- Gemini and ChatGPT (via DALL-E) support image generation in their main chatbot - you just have to ask.
- Explore various models on [HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces?category=image-generation), like FLUX
- [Ideogram](https://ideogram.ai/t/explore)
- [MidJourney](https://www.midjourney.com/explore?tab=top)

Some of the newer image generation algorithms have a 'digital art' sterility to them. Try your best to push it out of that lane. Try different styles, or different remixes of styles. Try different subjects.

Contribute your favorite two images to our class gallery in LucidSpark, linked to from Canvas. Under each image, include a Text Box (the big 'T' icon in the interface) with your prompt and tool.

***Step 2 - The Critic***

The goal of this step is to use image recognition functionality to critique other images. 

Using a language model with vision capabilities (e.g. all of Gemini, Claude, and ChatGPT have this), ask the AI to a short (less than 50 words) curator's statement.

There's a curation to this activity! The AI is writing the feedback, but you're encouraging it's behavior and selecting what you like. You can also edit it. Have fun with this. Make it silly or serious, or come up with different ways of prompting it to respond to the images. Don't be mean.

### Completion Details

Remember:

- Paste 2 of your images onto the canvas in an empty place
- A text box *below* your image is for the *artist's statement* (ie. prompt, model, optional title)
- Post-It notes *beside* the image are for others to add curator's statements. You should do the same on at least two others' images in our canvas.

### Portfolio Details

*Size: 1 point*

If including in portfolio: Include your two images, with their metadata - prompt, model, and optional title. Also include a brief statement of what you were aiming to do, and an assessment of how successful it was. You don't need to include your commentary from 'The Critic' section.

Grading will focus on creativity in the prompting process, sophistication of generated images (avoiding generic/cliched outputs), and thoughtful iteration based on results.
