## AI Tool Evaluation Journal

*Week 1*

Competencies: ***Critical Analysis, Fluency, and Evaluation***, Technical Understanding, Skilling and Productivity

### Overview

Compare different AI tools on specific tasks to understand their capabilities, limitations, and appropriate use cases.

### Details

- Select 2 different AI tools (e.g., [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), [Claude](https://claude.ai/), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)), or two different models from the same tool
- Write a basic query. It can be anything you like, but some ideas:
    - recommendations (e.g. getting a movie or book you might like, suggesting gifts)
    - information gathering (e.g. researching a topic, finding histories about a certain topic)
    - creative ideation feedback (e.g. brainstorming ideas, writing stories)
- Document differences in outputs for identical prompts
- Analyze strengths/weaknesses for different types of tasks
- Consider factors like accuracy, creativity, reasoning ability, and overall ‘vibes’

You can also try systems that show different models side by side. For example, [Chatbot Arena](https://lmarena.ai/) is a project that shows you two secret models, and you can choose the better option of the two. Another tool is the [Vercel playground](https://sdk.vercel.ai/playground/) (to use without an account, choose models that don’t say ‘Hobby’ or ‘Pro’).

You may notice some modules have different sizes (e.g. ‘8B’ vs ‘27B’in the model name, or ‘-mini’, or ‘haiku/sonnet/opus’). How much is lost with smaller/bigger models?

### Completion Details

We’ll discuss and compare results in group discussion.

Even though we’re just discussing it, it’s good to keep notes or screenshots in case this enters your portfolio.

### Portfolio Details

*Size: 1 point*

If including in portfolio: compare models at least three queries, jotting down brief notes on the differences you observe between each (point-form is fine), and summarize your impressions with one or two paragraphs.

You can choose the approach for what you focus on; for example, do you have model recommendations? Did you not observe any variability? What other quirk did you note? Would a specific system’s characteristics be better or less suited for specific types of tasks?

You can also choose what types of comparisons you want to make. Different company’s systems? 

**Grading**

Grading focus will be on: whether the submission demonstrates thoughtful comparison and critical analysis of the AI tools tested; demonstration of fluency in interpreting AI results; understanding of different tools.
