# Co-Creativity and Professional Practice

----

## Skill Check 

- What is the role of temperature in generative models?
- What is zero-shot learning? Few-shot learning?
- Why might you want to use a reasoning model instead of a regular chat model?
- What are some key limitations of chat bots we discussed last week?
- How can you improve chat bot responses when they give poor answers?

----

## Lab Follow-Ups

- "Make it More" results
- "Bot Don't Kill My Vibe" insights

### Current Issues: DeepSeek R1

The reasoning model from last week, DeepSeek R1, has been in the news this week for a supposed (and belated; and slightly misdirected) existential crisis to US tech companies, and a Wall Street Tech drop.

Let's discuss it.

DeepSeek: https://chat.deepseek.com

1. What's clever about it? What are the challenges with it?
2. What's the problem for tech companies?
3. What's the takeaway?
4. What does this change?

The evolution of AI has been interesting. Even during the rapid commercialization, companies have competed through development, marketing and applications, not patent lawsuits. Most models have similar architectures, and the difference is in the data and training.

Big companies are trying to differentiate through *perceptions* of scale (we trained with sooooo many GPUs, so no one can beat us) and money (e.g. pushing copyright maximalist arguments) and recruiting (e.g. we have the best engineers, so no one can beat us).

While it seems like there are *many* companies that are training models, most of the energy is on *applications* - few care to compete with big US companies on training models, and the impression has been that the future will be scaffolded by a few

This story touches on a numerous class themes: technical, sociotechnical, and geopolitical.

Ask me anything! e.g. 

- Additional technological grounding beyond our week 2 foundations and last week's reasoning model talk:
  - What's *distillation*?
  - What's *reinforcement learning*? What's *RLHF*?
  - What's Mixture of Experts (MoE)?
- Does this recontextualize *The Bitter Lesson*?
- Why was the reaction so late? Why R1, when the news seems to react more to an older model?
- Was the cost truly that much less than US?
- policy edge notes: geopolitical implications; chip ban; open access

## The Human-AI Partnership

Core principle from syllabus: "A tool that can help you learn and execute better can free you to be more creative"

What makes a good creative partnership?

## Is AI Creative?

What do you think?

------

... let's introduce a key concept first

-----

## AI Effect

The "AI Effect" refers to how achievements in AI are often discounted as not being "real" intelligence once they become well understood.

[Larry Tesler](https://www.nomodes.com/larry-tesler-consulting/adages-and-coinages): "Intelligence is whatever machines haven't done yet" 

Rodney Brooks: "Every time we figure out a piece of it, it stops being magical; we say, 'Oh, that's just a computation.'" ([Wired, 2002](https://www.wired.com/2002/03/everywhere/))

-----

## Is AI Creative?

- Yes, by common definitions and tests of divergent thinking, it's able to show creativity
- But... maybe the definitions are too narrow?
- And is this question the interesting one? Does it have to be creative agnostic of us?

## ~~Does~~ Can AI Make You More Creative? <!--fit -->

-----

- Studies show mixed results
- AI can enhance originality but might reduce flexibility (Doshi and Hauser 2023); other studies show that it increases flexibility and lowers originality
- Tough to measure, because it's so implementation-dependent

## AI Can *Understand* Creativity

So, there's a lot of work to do, but it's also being applied in practice everyday

A few early insights:
- Implementation matters, and how the human applies the tool in the interest of creativity
- Over-reliance is a concern
- Different *types* of creativity are differentially supported (e.g. mini-c, little-c, proc-c, big-C)
- Systems are great at fluency (how many) and elaboration (how detailed) - this can be a good starting point for humans reflecting on ideas for a problem
- Systems can be nudged to be more creative
- Measuring co-creativity is difficult, because the human contribution (in selection, interaction, application, etc.) is often latent

## Giving your bot a voice and a directive <!--fit -->

----

## Context

- Instruction-tuned models are typically trained to recognized three 'voices':
  - **System**: The system's voice, which is the *meta* instructions
  - **User**: The user's voice, which is the voice of the person using the model.
  - **Assistant**: The model's voice, which is the voice of the model.

Not all interfaces make it possible (or easy) to change the system voice, but you can also use your first user directive to give instructions (albeit with more vulnerability to 'jailbreaks' - usually not a problem for personal uses)

## Upcoming Lab: *Prompt & Circumstance*

> Design a self-contained interactive experience (game, tool, or interface) that lives entirely within a single AI prompt. The experience should activate when a user types 'START' and maintain its designed behavior throughout the interaction.


I've been creating some examples
