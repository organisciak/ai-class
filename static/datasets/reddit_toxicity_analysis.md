| I fucking hate the "queer movement". I hate being lumped with a group just because I happen to be into dudes. I hate having expectations thrust upon me because of something I didn't even choose. I don't want to be part of your little club, I don't want you speaking for me, I don't want to be associated with you, I don't want to be "an LGBT". |    0.9  |

| If I recall correctly, they had just lost a class action suit to the employees over sexual harassment at the plant. Then the raid happened a few days later.

| "Simple truth"?  There's nothing simple about it.   There are many complicating factors, including the way that money from corporations influence lawmakers, the way that gerrymandering affects how the citizens of the US actually get to elect their congresspeople, the way that media outlets use their influence to shape the citizens' understanding of the dangers of climate change, the way that people tend to weigh short-term concerns over long-term concerns, etc.  This isn't a simple truth.  It isn't a simple topic.  We are not living in some kind of pure utopian democracy where every single action of the congress or the government in general is the direct will of the citizens.  It's not simple.                                                                                                                               |   -0.06 |

| No rational atheist argues that they can conclusively prove that there is no God, nor is the onus on them to do so (see FSM, etc.).

| The democrats have even less to offer you, believe me. You can't possibly be a libertarian and even consider an all encompassing socialist government. Republicans are simply a means to an end. In primaries we must get a libertarian into the election on the republican platform                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |   -0.06 |
| I would argue that doctors are some of the only people who do need to know your actual sex/gender and lifestyle choices.  Diseases can be sex specific and knowing if a person is on hormones or has had any surgeries is critical to care.  What if a person who identifies as a woman has testicles?  A doctor needs this information.  Heath care for the trans population is a huge issue right now and it looks like current care isn't adequate.  I haven't seen specific research on how this relates to non-binary, non transitioning, people but I would suspect that the stresses on non binary people could cause or worsen medical issues.  Changing a medical intake form is hardly changing the world and the quicker a doctor can gather correct and significant information on a patient the more likely the patient receives the best care. |   -0.06 |

| Aren't you all glad that every last Democrat held the line during the repeal and replace debacle? We 100% won that fight; not only did the ACA survive, the GOP looks like a bunch of monsters, and rightly so. Now we come through with better ideas next year. Berne Sanders is already rallying support for Medicaid for all, for example.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |         |

| Ok my specific example was an instance where a party needed more emotional support/attention than there partner was giving.

| I 100 percent agree. If someone has zero morals they can 'play capitalism' much better. But just because you don't have morals doesn't mean you always do the wrong thing. IE an unethical person can choose to be environmental purely because they know it will be good for the business's image. An unethical person can pay people a decent wage because they know those people are more likely to stick around. It's all about the bottom line and not doing the right thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |   -0.06 |

"Coerced sex is already a crime. If the parent tried to use their position to pressure their child into sex that would be illegal as that is not consensual sex under current legislation. It's the same as an employer saying ""if you want this job you have to have sex with me"" which is also illegal. In the example of the parent-child relationship, the child could testify that they were pressured into sex and therefore did not consent and the parent would go to prison.

In a separate instance where a parent and child chose to have consensual sex with each other, what gives a third party the right to say that, simply because one was a child of the other, that act was automatically not consensual? ",0.25

"> Because once a biological woman has undergone sex change or transitioned, they are then a male.

This sentiment supports the concept of your sex/gender being based on your external physical attributes. It ignores that your brain is very much a physical component of your body, and it's there in the brain that people are Male or Female or SomethingElse.

There is no ""becoming a woman"" or ""becoming a man"". There are only techniques people use to make their outward appearance align with their internal sense of self so they don't feel a jarring reaction every time someone says they are something they are not.

I would strongly encourage you to educate yourself more on this issue, because you'll draw a lot of false conclusions if you don't understand the nature of how sex/gender really behaves scientifically as well as socially/culturally.

"Wouldn't need to wipe the memory if they simply changed the course of time.... 

Ever hear of Last Thursdayism?  It's the idea that the Universe in its entirety was created last Thursday, in it's current form, with all your memories formed at that moment... how would you know?

Now, normally Occam's Razor can cut through that shit like butter... But here's the thing, they've recently discovered that large events can send ripples through time in *both* directions, affecting both future and past events.

So, if something big happens 100 years in the future, and the effects rippled back in time 100 years to last Thursday, altering events and basically popping you into existence, how would you know?",0.29

>*When first created, the Chamber was accessed through a concealed trapdoor and a series of magical tunnels. However, when Hogwarts’ plumbing became more elaborate in the eighteenth century (this was a rare instance of wizards copying Muggles, because hitherto they simply relieved themselves wherever they stood, and vanished the evidence), the entrance to the Chamber was threatened, being located on the site of a proposed bathroom.*

So.... until the 18th century, wizards just shat themselves where they stood, and magicked it away.

"Like thebottomofawhale mentioned, economic state can vary quite a bit within boroughs. However it is worth noting that the low crime boroughs in the south west (Richmond, Kingston, Merton and Sutton) are generally quite well off. Also the borough just to the left of the dark red one, which appears to have relatively low crime for the area, is Kensington and Chelsea, one of the wealthiest boroughs in London. 

The map also doesn't show what kind of crimes are committed. Kensington and Chelsea gets more theft and burglary due to the extreme wealth, whereas other poorer boroughs will get more violent crime. ",0.12
